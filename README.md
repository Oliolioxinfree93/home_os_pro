# Home OS Pro

## Meals setup

The new Meals tab uses two Supabase tables: `children` and `meal_feedback`.

1. Open your Supabase SQL editor.
2. Run `supabase/meals_schema.sql`.
3. Refresh the Streamlit app.

If this schema is not installed yet, the Meals tab will show a warning and continue running without crashing.
